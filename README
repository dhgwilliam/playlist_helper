An example of importing playlists into Rdio.

First run authenticate.py to authenticate against the Rdio service.

Then you can run either hypempopular.py or we-are-hunted.py to try importing
Hype Machine's popular tracks or the current We Are Hunted popular tracks.

Both of these use the code in playlistcreator.py to match artist and track
names against Rdio's catalog. The matching is fuzzy, using Levenshtein
edit distance and simple transforms to find inexact matches.

This uses the Rdio Python library from: https://github.com/rdio/rdio-python

`python playlist_helper/authenticate.py`
